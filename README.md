# Hi, I'm Paul-Christiaan 👋 🏊🚴🏃 💻

I'm a **CTO** and a **Microsoft 365 Architect** and I'm passionate about **frontend technologies** and everything related to the cloud, especially **Microsoft Azure**.
I currently live in **Zurich** and actively participate in local and international community activities and events.
I share my love for technology through my blog <a href="https://dev.to/kasuken" target="_blank">dev.to/kasuken</a>.
I also became Twitch Affiliate as a **live coder** and you can follow me at <a href="https://twitch.tv/kasuken" target="_blank">twitch.tv/kasuken</a> to write some code together.
